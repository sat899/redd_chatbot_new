Forest carbon markets page,page,https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/learning-journal-forest-carbon-markets,"In a nutshell, carbon markets are trading systems in which carbon credits are sold and bought. Companies or individuals can use carbon markets to compensate for their greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits from entities that remove or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

The Learning Journal looks at forest-based carbon market approaches, covering high-integrity market initiatives, voluntary and compliance market dynamics, their role in NDCs and corporate claims, and steps for governments to establish robust frameworks, including MRV systems and carbon trading contracts under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

By the end of this learning journal, you will be able to  understand the status quo of high-integrity forest carbon markets.  First, users will understand the difference between market and non-market approaches.  Second, high-integrity carbon markets initiatives are presented and explained. Third, the differences (and intersections) between voluntary and compliance markets (including crediting mechanism, emission trade and Article 6 of the Paris Agreement) are presented. Fourth, the role of forest carbon markets in the context of National Determined Contributions (NDCs) and corporate claims will be explained. 

After completing this module, users will be able to understand the main building blocks that national and/or subnational governments need to address to enable forest carbon markets with high integrity. The first one is assessing risks and opportunities related to forest carbon markets. Based on this assessment, guidance is given to define and implement an appropriate policy, regulatory, and governance framework (that includes FREL/FRL revision, establishing a monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) system, a registry system, a nesting system, and a safeguards system). The role of national authorities will be explained, including regarding Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Finally, the users will be able to understand the critical elements of carbon trading contracts.",

Understanding REDD+ and the UNFCCC page,page,https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/leanring-journal-redd-plus-safeguards-under-the-unfccc,"This journal presents the basics of REDD+ under the UNFCCC. 

Objective: Focuses on the relationship between REDD+ and the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), including key agreements.

Countries interested in REDD+ are required to progress through three phases, which are closely linked with one another (UNFCCC Decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 73):
1. Readiness phase, involving the development of national strategies or action plans, REDD+ mitigation actions, and capacity building;
2. Implementation of national strategies and results-based demonstration activities, enacting REDD+ actions and national strategies or plans that could involve further capacity building, technology development and transfer, and results-based demonstration activities;
3. Results-based actions that must be fully measured, reported and verified.

By the end of this learning journal, you will be able to understand the foundational role of REDD+ within the context of international climate agreements, particularly under the UNFCCC.

The module includes sections about:
1. What REDD+ is and how it has been negotiated at the global level
2. REDD+ implementation at the national level and related challenges
3. International initiatives to support REDD+ implementation at the national level

National Strategies and Action Plans page,page,https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/learning-journal-national-strategies-and-action-plans ,"NS/APs describe how emissions will be reduced and/or how forest carbon stocks will be enhanced, conserved and/or sustainably managed through the implementation of REDD+. NS/APs are integrative products of the readiness phase (phase 1). They draw on the analytical work, stakeholder dialogue and strategic decisions made to guide the implementation of REDD+ (phases 2 and 3). They are expected to be revised cyclically to integrate lessons learned and changes in context over time (i.e. changing threats and new opportunities).

However, beyond simply guiding REDD+ implementation or addressing a UNFCCC requirement, NS/AP documents and design processes are also opportunities and tools to achieve multiple objectives, as various countries have done (e.g. Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, or Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)). This includes especially contributing to the development objectives of the country as well as, to the extent possible, objectives of sectors key to REDD+ (i.e. drivers) through different pathways. 

This journal focuses on the formulation and implementation of national strategies for REDD+, including aligning with international climate commitments. By the end of this learning journal, you will be able to understand the steps involved in creating national REDD+ strategies and their alignment with international climate agreements

National Forest Monitoring Systems for REDD+ (FAO) page,page,https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/learning-journal-national-forest-monitoring-systems-for-redd-plus ,"FAO has supported more than 50 countries in their development of robust National Forest Monitoring Systems (NFMS) and assessments, with the goal of developing reliable forest resource information for application in creating national forest policies, planning and sustainable development. Forest monitoring systems include measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) functions and aim to produce high-quality, reliable data on forests, including forest-carbon estimates, that are critical to the battle against climate change caused by among others deforestation and degradation of forests. 

NFMS components include: 
1. Satellite land monitoring systems (SLMS) and other data collection providing information for activity data (AD)
2. National Forest Inventories (NFI) or other data collection providing information on emission factors (EF)

This journal provides an overview of forest monitoring systems that track deforestation and forest carbon stocks, which are essential for REDD+ reporting. By the end of this learning journal, you will be able to learn about the technical and scientific methods used for monitoring forests, deforestation, and carbon emissions in REDD+ programs. We include here content for two of the courses related to NFMS, the Forests and transparency under the Paris Agreement and Institutionalization of forest data.

In line with that, FAO has been developing am E-learning series. The full set of courses related to Forest monitoring for climate action can be found at https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=1000.",

Forest Reference Emission Levels (FAO) page,page,https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/learning-journal-forest-reference-emission-levels ,"To participate in REDD+, countries must develop a Forest Reference Emission Level and/or Forest Reference Level. These are benchmarks for assessing their performance in implementing REDD+ activities.

Countries that implement REDD+ and reduce carbon can report REDD+ results to the UNFCCC. These REDD+ results compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during REDD+ implementation against the reference level. Countries also develop national GHG inventories and regularly report on emissions to the UNFCCC. FAO aims to support countries in developing these inventory systems that can generate consistent estimates for forest reference levels and REDD+ results reporting.

FAOï¿½s REDD+ and National Forest Monitoring team supports capacity development for FREL/FRLs, REDD+ results reporting and national GHG inventory systems in the land-use sector. Technical capacities to work with data and carry out calculations are required as are functional capacities including system-related aspects such as inventory planning and management, data sharing, quality checking and continuous improvement. 

This module covers Forest Reference Emission Levels (FRELs), which are used to benchmark forest carbon emissions for REDD+ programs. By the end of this learning journal, you will be able to understand the concept of FRELs and how they are used to monitor and verify emission reductions within REDD+ projects.

In line with that, FAO has been developing am E-learning series.

REDD+ safeguards (UNEP) page,page,https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/leanring-journal-redd-plus-safeguards-under-the-unfccc ,"The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) defined the safeguards to be observed in the implementation of actions for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation - REDD+ (Appendix I to Decision 1 / CP.16). REDD + safeguards are also known as Cancun safeguards and aim to ensure that REDD + initiatives adequately address sensitive issues such as the rights of indigenous peoples and traditional communities, social participation, preservation of natural ecosystems, the permanence of achieved REDD+ results and the risk of displacement of the pressure from deforestation and forest degradation to other areas.

The seven Cancun safeguards state that REDD + initiatives should promote and support:

1. That actions complement or are consistent with the objectives of national forest programs and relevant international conventions and agreements;
2. Transparent and effective national forest governance structures, taking into account national legislation and sovereignty;
3. Respect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities, by taking into account relevant international obligations, national circumstances and laws, and noting that the United Nations General Assembly has adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples;
4. The full and effective participation of relevant stakeholders, in particular indigenous peoples and local communities;
5. That actions are consistent with the conservation of natural forests and biological diversity, ensuring that the actions referred to in paragraph 70 of Decision 1/CP.16 are not used for the conversion of natural forests, but are instead used to incentivize the protection and conservation of natural forests and their ecosystem services, and to enhance other social and environmental benefits;
6. Actions to address the risks of reversals;
7. Actions to reduce displacement of emissions.

This journal focuses on the environmental and social safeguards required under the UNFCCC for REDD+ implementation, ensuring respect for human rights. By the end of this learning journal, you will be able to understand the safeguards in REDD+ under the UNFCCC framework, ensuring environmental protection and social equity.",

Nesting approaches for REDD+ (UNEP) page,page,https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/learning-journal-nesting-approaches-for-redd-plus ,"Nested REDD+ refers to a patchwork of approaches that seek to create a common accounting system and/or crediting system in order to integrate existing REDD+ projects into REDD+ programs. This can range from simply accounting for all emissions reductions and cutting out crediting of projects from the broader REDD+ program to seeking to integrate project crediting directly within the existing programï¿½s approach to benefits sharing.

This Learning Journal on Nesting Approaches for REDD+ forms part of the revitalized REDD+ Academy. It aims to bridge the understanding and practical application of nesting, which entails aligning REDD+ initiatives across various geographical and administrative scales into a consistent accounting system at the jurisdictional (subnational or national) level, with consideration of key governance and safeguards aspects. This Learning Journal is intended to serve as a guide for government practitioners but may also be of interest to project developers, public and private funders, and REDD+ technical assistance partners. 

The Journal includes information on what is nesting, why nesting might be needed, how and when nesting approaches may be developed and implemented, and what actions may be needed to ensure adequate carbon accounting, governance, and safeguards across multiple scales of REDD+ implementation. It features case studies and examples, exploring challenges, opportunities, and emerging good practices in developing nesting approaches for REDD+. This will highlight crucial considerations to help design country-specific nesting approaches that enhance environmental integrity and enable access to and scaling up of forest carbon finance and successful REDD+ implementation. It also includes a Nesting Decision Tree to help guide decision-making on nesting, as well as information on practical considerations and steps related to carbon accounting, governance, and safeguards aspects related to nesting.

By the end of this learning journal, you will be able to:
Assess your actual knowledge about nesting in REDD+

Drivers of deforestation (FAO),page,https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/drivers-of-deforestation-fao,"Deforestation and forest degradation are complex transboundary processes with many direct as well as underlying causes. A good understanding of why and where forest disturbances occur is instrumental for the development of targeted policies and actions aiming to reduce the loss of forests and the associated carbon emissions. ?

Carefully and systematically analysing and comprehensively addressing all direct and underlying drivers of deforestation and degradation of forests is the priority and key prerequisite to effectively reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and thus enhancing forest carbon stocks in every REDD+ country. While drivers of deforestation vary in different places, particular attention should be given to addressing the conversion of forests to agricultural land, which is by far the greatest driver globally. Overexploitation and unsustainable forest management practices are the main human-induced causes of forest degradation. Measures and strategies to address drivers should seek to harmonize different development objectives taking into account the need for increased food production and improved livelihoods as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation and enhanced environmental conservation. A cross-sectoral ï¿½landscape approachï¿½, encompassing all land uses would contribute to halting both deforestation and forest degradation while meeting future demands for food and nutrition.

The Central African Forest Initiative (CAFI) and FAO are collaborating on the development of a standardized approach to assess direct drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, piloted in six countries in Central Africa: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon.

In the context of REDD+, PAMs drive the implementation of REDD+ activities, either as a prime objective or alongside other priorities (such as integrated rural development and/or resilience to climate change and natural disasters). PAMs to achieve REDD+ may not be new or innovative, since many countries have already established PAMs to address deforestation or forest degradation, and/or to promote conservation and sustainable management of forests. However, REDD+ provides an opportunity to look at issues driving forest loss, and corresponding solutions, from a wider crosssectoral perspective. With this approach, and building on existing interventions, the objective will be to ensure that relevant efforts are sustained and improved on in order to increase their impact.

This is a problem as gender equity is essential for tackling more sustainable forest management, and to achieving the aims of REDD+, which aims to reduce emissions and conserve forests in specific countries.

REDD+ aims to compensate countries that reduce emissions from land use and land use change, as well as conserving, sustainably managing or enhancing forests, as a means of mitigating climate change.

Women play a key role in managing forests but are often left on the sidelines of international and national policymaking. The same is true when it comes to sharing the benefits of climate investment finance.",
Social inclusion and stakeholder engagement (UNDP),page,https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/social-inclusion-and-stakeholder-engagement-undp,"No forest solution or REDD+ action will succeed and endure unless the diverse forest stakeholders and rightsholders are fully and effectively engaged in defining and implementing policies, partnerships and financing schemes. This is particularly critical in the case of indigenous peoples and local communities, as many international agreements and policies in the climate arena have clearly stated over the years, from the UNFCCC to global partnerships for sustainable development.

Forests are the homeland and primary livelihood of some 70 million indigenous peoples, as well as countless rural communities living in or around forests. These stakeholders have political, territorial, economic and land-tenure rights, claims, and needs that should be respected and promoted in REDD+. They also possess unique knowledge of forests and sustainable forest management that deserves recognition and support.

Social inclusion is ultimately about full and equal engagement of the diverse stakeholders and rightsholders to forge public policies and field actions. Hence a broad stakeholder engagement approach is required, so that diverse governmental sectors and agencies, civil society actors, indigenous peoples, development practitioners, the private sector and the development financiers, among others, work together to devise, implement and monitor forest solutions to the climate emergency.

REDD+ finance (UNEP),page,https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/redd-plus-finance-unep,"All IPCC pathways to keep global warming below 1.5ï¿½C are fully dependent on deforestation falling to net zero by 2030. The scale of financing required to achieve the full climate mitigation potential of forests will be substantial, perhaps as high as 5.5% of national GDP for tropical forest countries.

Development finance in the form of grants and concessional loans will still play a role in supporting implementation of REDD+ and will contribute to upfront finance. It is unlikely, however, that this approach will provide the multiple tens of billions of dollars required to achieve forest-based mitigation results at the scale necessary by the end of the decade. Achieving the level of REDD+ finance compatible with the 2030 mitigation goals will need large-scale investments from the private sector and donor support to massively scale up results-based payments.

The UN-REDD Programme has mobilized $1 billion US in REDD+ financing since inception, including $350 million US in results-based payments. While REDD+ readiness will continue to be necessary in a number of places, the bulk of finance needed for the coming decade will be in support of the implementation of actions that result in reduced emissions and increased carbon capture from forests.

The scaling up of REDD+, which is necessary to meet the Paris Agreement goals, will require financing for a spectrum of actions including readiness, implementation and ultimately, for ensuring integrity in emission reductions. The growing and diverse supply of forest-based mitigation results needs to be met by a complementary spectrum of public and private results-based finance.

This journal explains the financial aspects of REDD+ implementation, including funding sources and mechanisms for distributing resources for forest conservation.

LEAF corporates and sovereigns: Commit funding for emissions reductions to specific jurisdictions (countries and/or subnational regions). LEAF has corporate demand ready to transact at $10 per credit.
Emergent signs: Involves ERPA (Emission Reduction Purchase Agreements) with corporate buyers, ERPAs and Funding Agreements with jurisdictions, and contribution agreements with sovereign donors.
LEAF jurisdictions: Aim to reduce deforestation against a benchmark through national or sub-national scale forest protection programs.
Results-based emission reductions: Emission reductions (ERs) are verified by independent verification bodies, issued by ART (Architecture for REDD+ Transactions), and retired on completion.
Funds paid to LEAF jurisdictions: Funds are directed to LEAF jurisdictions and other stakeholders by Emergent through a Financial Intermediary, following best practices for reinvestment in sustainable development and forest protection.
Reinvestment: Focuses on reinvesting in projects that support sustainable development and improve the lives and livelihoods of people in LEAF jurisdictions.
The LEAF Coalition coordinates this initiative to support large-scale forest conservation and sustainable development by providing financial incentives for verified emissions reductions.",
