Nesting approaches for REDD+ (UNEP),https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/nesting-approaches-for-redd-plus-unep,Nested REDD+ refers to a patchwork of approaches that seek to create a common accounting system and/or crediting system in order to integrate existing REDD+ projects into REDD+ programs. This can range from simply accounting for all emissions reductions and cutting out crediting of projects from the broader REDD+ program to seeking to integrate project crediting directly within the existing program’s approach to benefits sharing.
Carbon markets for REDD+ (UNEP),https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/carbon-markets-for-redd-plus-unep,"In a nutshell, carbon markets are trading systems in which carbon credits are sold and bought. Companies or individuals can use carbon markets to compensate for their greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits from entities that remove or reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

By the end of this learning journal, you will be able to:
Assess whether different types of carbon markets contribute to their climate goals, given the international circumstances.
Make very specific policy decisions and regulatory decisions to assess a specific transaction.
Apply the RBF knowledge to improve the policy/regulatory guidance by leveraging and revising the existing polices and regulations.
Build robust frameworks and capacities to maximize results based finance.
Estimate and predict the benefits from participating in the results based finance process.
Compare the opportunities and risks of different carbon market options with understanding of the trade-offs.
Formulate strategies and action plans for accessing the selected options keeping in mind resource, capacity gaps, and political will.
Apply principles for high-integrity nested approaches in establishing MRV/registry benefit-sharing plans."
REDD+ safeguards (UNEP),https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/redd-plus-safeguards-unep,"The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) defined the safeguards to be observed in the implementation of actions for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation - REDD+ (Appendix I to Decision 1 / CP.16). REDD + safeguards are also known as Cancun safeguards and aim to ensure that REDD + initiatives adequately address sensitive issues such as the rights of indigenous peoples and traditional communities, social participation, preservation of natural ecosystems, the permanence of achieved REDD+ results and the risk of displacement of the pressure from deforestation and forest degradation to other areas.

The seven Cancun safeguards state that REDD + initiatives should promote and support:

1. That actions complement or are consistent with the objectives of national forest programs and relevant international conventions and agreements;
2. Transparent and effective national forest governance structures, taking into account national legislation and sovereignty;
3. Respect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities, by taking into account relevant international obligations, national circumstances and laws, and noting that the United Nations General Assembly has adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples;
4. The full and effective participation of relevant stakeholders, in particular indigenous peoples and local communities;
5. That actions are consistent with the conservation of natural forests and biological diversity, ensuring that the actions referred to in paragraph 70 of Decision 1/CP.16 are not used for the conversion of natural forests, but are instead used to incentivize the protection and conservation of natural forests and their ecosystem services, and to enhance other social and environmental benefits;
6. Actions to address the risks of reversals;
7. Actions to reduce displacement of emissions."
National Strategies and Action Plans (UNDP),https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/national-strategies-and-action-plans-undp,"NS/APs describe how emissions will be reduced and/or how forest carbon stocks will be enhanced, conserved and/or sustainably managed through the implementation of REDD+. NS/APs are integrative products of the readiness phase (phase 1). They draw on the analytical work, stakeholder dialogue and strategic decisions made to guide the implementation of REDD+ (phases 2 and 3). They are expected to be revised cyclically to integrate lessons learned and changes in context over time (i.e. changing threats and new opportunities).

However, beyond simply guiding REDD+ implementation or addressing a UNFCCC requirement, NS/AP documents and design processes are also opportunities and tools to achieve multiple objectives, as various countries have done (e.g. Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, or Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)). This includes especially contributing to the development objectives of the country as well as, to the extent possible, objectives of sectors key to REDD+ (i.e. drivers) through different pathways. "
REDD+ under UNFCCC (UNDP),https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/redd-plus-under-unfccc-undp,"This module presents the basics of REDD+ under the UNFCCC. 

Countries interested in REDD+ are required to progress through three phases, which are closely linked with one another (UNFCCC Decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 73):
1. Readiness phase, involving the development of national strategies or action plans, REDD+ mitigation actions, and capacity building;
2. Implementation of national strategies and results-based demonstration activities, enacting REDD+ actions and national strategies or plans that could involve further capacity building, technology development and transfer, and results-based demonstration activities;
3. Results-based actions that must be fully measured, reported and verified.

The module includes sections about:
1. What REDD+ is and how it has been negotiated at the global level
2. REDD+ implementation at the national level and related challenges
3. International initiatives to support REDD+ implementation at the national level
"
FREL (FAO),https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/frel-fao,"To participate in REDD+, countries must develop a Forest Reference Emission Level and/or Forest Reference Level. These are benchmarks for assessing their performance in implementing REDD+ activities.

Countries that implement REDD+ and reduce carbon can report REDD+ results to the UNFCCC. These REDD+ results compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during REDD+ implementation against the reference level. Countries also develop national GHG inventories and regularly report on emissions to the UNFCCC. FAO aims to support countries in developing these inventory systems that can generate consistent estimates for forest reference levels and REDD+ results reporting.

FAO’s REDD+ and National Forest Monitoring team supports capacity development for FREL/FRLs, REDD+ results reporting and national GHG inventory systems in the land-use sector. Technical capacities to work with data and carry out calculations are required as are functional capacities including system-related aspects such as inventory planning and management, data sharing, quality checking and continuous improvement. "
NFMS (FAO),https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/nfms-fao,"FAO has supported more than 50 countries in their development of robust National Forest Monitoring Systems (NFMS) and assessments, with the goal of developing reliable forest resource information for application in creating national forest policies, planning and sustainable development. Forest monitoring systems include measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) functions and aim to produce high-quality, reliable data on forests, including forest-carbon estimates, that are critical to the battle against climate change caused by among others deforestation and degradation of forests. 

NFMS components include: 
1. Satellite land monitoring systems (SLMS) and other data collection providing information for activity data (AD)
2. National Forest Inventories (NFI) or other data collection providing information on emission factors (EF)"
Gender and REDD+ (UNDP),https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/gender-and-redd-plus-undp,"Women from poor, forest-dependent communities play a key role in the management of forests, and yet they are frequently marginalised from decision-making in communities. This is a problem as gender equity is essential for tackling more sustainable forest management, and to achieving the aims of REDD+, which aims to reduce emissions and conserve forests in specific countries.

REDD+ aims to compensate countries that reduce emissions from land use and land use change, as well as conserving, sustainably managing or enhancing forests, as a means of mitigating climate change.

Women play a key role in managing forests but are often left on the sidelines of international and national policymaking. The same is true when it comes to sharing the benefits of climate investment finance."
Social inclusion and stakeholder engagement (UNDP),https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/social-inclusion-and-stakeholder-engagement-undp,"No forest solution or REDD+ action will succeed and endure unless the diverse forest stakeholders and rightsholders are fully and effectively engaged in defining and implementing policies, partnerships and financing schemes. This is particularly critical in the case of indigenous peoples and local communities, as many international agreements and policies in the climate arena have clearly stated over the years, from the UNFCCC to global partnerships for sustainable development.

Forests are the homeland and primary livelihood of some 70 million indigenous peoples, as well as countless rural communities living in or around forests. These stakeholders have political, territorial, economic and land-tenure rights, claims, and needs that should be respected and promoted in REDD+. They also possess unique knowledge of forests and sustainable forest management that deserves recognition and support.

Social inclusion is ultimately about full and equal engagement of the diverse stakeholders and rightsholders to forge public policies and field actions. Hence a broad stakeholder engagement approach is required, so that diverse governmental sectors and agencies, civil society actors, indigenous peoples, development practitioners, the private sector and the development financiers, among others, work together to devise, implement and monitor forest solutions to the climate emergency."
PAM (FAO),https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/pam-fao,"Policies and measures (PAMs) can be understood as actions taken and/or mandated by governments to achieve a set of objectives. They may consist of the design or reform of policies or legal and regulatory frameworks, as well as actual investments (programmes and projects). In the context of REDD+, PAMs drive the implementation of REDD+ activities, either as a prime objective or alongside other priorities (such as integrated rural development and/or resilience to climate change and natural disasters). PAMs to achieve REDD+ may not be new or innovative, since many countries have already established PAMs to address deforestation or forest degradation, and/or to promote conservation and sustainable management of forests. However, REDD+ provides an opportunity to look at issues driving forest loss, and corresponding solutions, from a wider crosssectoral perspective. With this approach, and building on existing interventions, the objective will be to ensure that relevant efforts are sustained and improved on in order to increase their impact."
Drivers of deforestation (FAO),https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/drivers-of-deforestation-fao,"Deforestation and forest degradation are complex transboundary processes with many direct as well as underlying causes. A good understanding of why and where forest disturbances occur is instrumental for the development of targeted policies and actions aiming to reduce the loss of forests and the associated carbon emissions. ?

Carefully and systematically analysing and comprehensively addressing all direct and underlying drivers of deforestation and degradation of forests is the priority and key prerequisite to effectively reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and thus enhancing forest carbon stocks in every REDD+ country. While drivers of deforestation vary in different places, particular attention should be given to addressing the conversion of forests to agricultural land, which is by far the greatest driver globally. Overexploitation and unsustainable forest management practices are the main human-induced causes of forest degradation. Measures and strategies to address drivers should seek to harmonize different development objectives taking into account the need for increased food production and improved livelihoods as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation and enhanced environmental conservation. A cross-sectoral “landscape approach”, encompassing all land uses would contribute to halting both deforestation and forest degradation while meeting future demands for food and nutrition.

The Central African Forest Initiative (CAFI) and FAO are collaborating on the development of a standardized approach to assess direct drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, piloted in six countries in Central Africa: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon."
REDD+ finance (UNEP),https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/redd-plus-finance-unep,"All IPCC pathways to keep global warming below 1.5°C are fully dependent on deforestation falling to net zero by 2030. The scale of financing required to achieve the full climate mitigation potential of forests will be substantial, perhaps as high as 5.5% of national GDP for tropical forest countries.

Development finance in the form of grants and concessional loans will still play a role in supporting implementation of REDD+ and will contribute to upfront finance. It is unlikely, however, that this approach will provide the multiple tens of billions of dollars required to achieve forest-based mitigation results at the scale necessary by the end of the decade. Achieving the level of REDD+ finance compatible with the 2030 mitigation goals will need large-scale investments from the private sector and donor support to massively scale up results-based payments.

The UN-REDD Programme has mobilized $1 billion US in REDD+ financing since inception, including $350 million US in results-based payments. While REDD+ readiness will continue to be necessary in a number of places, the bulk of finance needed for the coming decade will be in support of the implementation of actions that result in reduced emissions and increased carbon capture from forests.

The scaling up of REDD+, which is necessary to meet the Paris Agreement goals, will require financing for a spectrum of actions including readiness, implementation and ultimately, for ensuring integrity in emission reductions. The growing and diverse supply of forest-based mitigation results needs to be met by a complementary spectrum of public and private results-based finance."
