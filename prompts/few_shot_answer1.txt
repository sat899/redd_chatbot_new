Based on your previous interactions and preferences, I recommend the following learning resources related to REDD+:\n 1. **National Strategies and Action Plans (UNDP)** - This resource discusses how countries develop plans to reduce emissions and enhance forest carbon stocks through the implementation of REDD+. It provides guidance on integrating multiple objectives into these strategies. I’ve recommended this resource for three reasons. Firstly because it fits with your profile of being the national coordinator for REDD+ projects in Botswana. Secondly it is quite similar to resources you have interacted with before. Lastly, it is also a popular resource amongst users with similar profiles to you.

I’ve recommended this resource because it is very similar to ones you have interacted with before.

I’ve recommended this resource because people with similar profiles to you tend to interact with it more often.
