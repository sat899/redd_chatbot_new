Based on your previous interactions and preferences, I recommend the following learning resources related to REDD+:\n 1. ** NFMS (FAO)** - This resource will help you enhance your capacity in developing robust forest monitoring systems, and for improving data collection and analysis for better forest resource information. I’ve recommended this resource because you have expressed a specific interest in forest monitoring, this resource is quite similar to ones you have interacted with before, and users who are similar to you are much more likely to interact with it compared to the average user.

I’ve recommended this resource because it is relevant to your role, it is very similar to resources you’ve interacted with before, and people with similar profiles to you tend to interact with it more often.

It provides guidance on integrating multiple objectives into these strategies. I’ve recommended this resource because it is quite similar to other resources you have interacted with.
