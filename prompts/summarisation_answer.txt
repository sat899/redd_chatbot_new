Developing a nested system involves the following steps: \n Step 1: Assess multiple scales of REDD+ implementation -  In countries where a range of funding mechanisms and scales of REDD+ implementation are present, it is important to ensure alignment among them. Different  requirements from multiple funding sources can pose significant challenges for the accounting and reporting of emission reductions.  The first step is to identify if there are different scales of REDD+ implementation. \n Step 2: Identifying overlaps - An initial evaluation of the scales at which REDD+ is being implemented, now or in the future, is just the beginning of a nesting decision process. As this process unfolds, the country may wish to assess overlaps between different REDD+ activities in time and space. This may require discussion and coordination with subnational project proponents, as well as with relevant carbon standards. Engaging with various stakeholders early and continuously, through a gender-sensitive and inclusive approach, can provide valuable insights and help streamline the process, making it more efficient, cost-effective, and equitable. Once it is determined that there are multiple scales of REDD+ implementation, it is important to identify overlaps in terms of 1) the geographic areas where REDD+ activities are being implemented; 2) the specific REDD+ activities being developed; and 3) the crediting periods for these activities. \n Step 3: Evaluate the impact of overlaps -  Once it is determined there is a multi-scale implementation of REDD+ with potentially overlapping claims, the next step is to assess the impact of these overlaps. Depending on the significance of the impact, a few different approaches can be considered.  The significance of the impact refers to how the quantity of emissions reductions from lower-scale REDD+ implementation affects the results achieved at the higher implementation scale. This will depend on various factors, including national circumstances, contextual considerations and carbon accounting analyses.  If no overlaps are identified, it may be worthwhile for the jurisdiction to determine whether future overlaps are likely. This involves assessing the likelihood of potential new project developments or ambition by sub-national jurisdictions to gain access to carbon finance. Some preliminary conversations with these stakeholders may help determine how these ambitions may affect the national jurisdictionâ€™s carbon accounting, and whether it would be advantageous to begin developing a comprehensive nesting approach. The elements of such a system will be explained in more detail in later sections. Here we describe and share case studies for the two simpler approaches illustrated in the decision tree: subtraction and negotiation. \n Step 4: Define the nesting approach - If, after considering previous steps, a subnational or national jurisdiction decides to pursue a more comprehensive nesting approach, there are three key aspects which may be taken into account to develop a nesting approach. /n For more information about nesting in REDD+ please refer to the following learning journal: **Nesting Approaches for REDD+** [Link to resource](https://reddacademy.in.howspace.com/nesting-approaches-for-redd-plus-unep#widget-673b547dacb5ab4efb0afb02#widget-673b547dacb5ab4efb0afb02)
